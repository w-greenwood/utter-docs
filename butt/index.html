		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Broadcast Using This Tool (BUTT) is the streaming software Utter uses in it's studios to send audio to it's
			<a href="../radioco/index.html">aggregator (Radio.Co)</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Step-sy-step
		</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>Starting a broadcast</summary>
			<p>
				Sending out a broadcast over BUTT is fairly straightforward.
			</p>
			<img src="./media/controlsstepby.png">
			<p>
				Before you begin a broadcast, it is best practice to double check that BUTT is targeting Utter's
				Radio.co server.
				To do this, open the <mark>Settings</mark> menu <dfn>1</dfn> and select the <mark>Main</mark> tab
				<dfn>2</dfn>.
			</p>
			<img src="./media/settingsstepby.png">
			<p>
				Near the top of the <mark>Main</mark> tab, there will be a box labeled <mark>Server settings</mark>.
				At the top of this section, there is a server selection dropdown <dfn>3</dfn> - this should be set to
				the "Utter" preset.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary>
					If no "Utter" preset is avaialable.
				</summary>
				<p>
					You can create a new preset using the server <mark>Add</mark> button <dfn>4</dfn>.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/serversstepby.png">
				<p>
					A popup will open with a list of server types - each with their own respective options. From the
					list on the left, select <mark>Radio.co</mark> <dfn>5</dfn>, then click <mark>Get staitons</mark>
					<dfn>6</dfn>.
					You will be prompted to log in to Radio.co - if you haven't already signed up for an account,
					contact the station manager to do so.
				</p>
			</details>
			<p>
				Now that you've confirmed BUTT is targeting Utter's Radio.co server, close the settings window and use
				the <mark>Connect to Server</mark> button <dfn>7</dfn> on the main control panel to begin the broadcast.
				The broadcast will begin immediately.
			</p>

				<dd>
					Gain that applies to both the recording and the stream output.

			<summary>Input Ouptput</summary>
			<img src="./media/audio.comprehensive.png">
			<dl>
				<dt><dfn>1</dfn> Channel Mode</dt>
				<dd>
					Toggles between stereo and mono broadcasting.
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>2</dfn> Samplerate</dt>
				<dd>
					Sets the sampling frequency for broadcasts and strems.<br>
					<em>(MUST match samplerate of audio interface (desk) and broadcast aggregator server)</em>.
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>3</dfn> Device Identification</dt>
				<dd>
					Finds and lists available audio input and output devices connected to the host computer.
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>4</dfn> Primary and Secondary Audo Devices</dt>
				<dd>
					Sets the audio input used for the primary and secondary audio feeds <em>(see mixer)</em>.<br>
					At least one input must be set for a broadcast to work.
					<mark>Left</mark> and <mark>Right</mark> dropdowns are used to assign channels from each device to left and right broadcasting outputs. For mono devices, left and right can both be set to channel 1.
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>5</dfn> Codec</dt>
				<dd>
					The format in which audio is streamed to the aggregator and recorded locally.<br>
					Advanced codec properties can be accessed through the cog icon on the right.
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn>6</dfn> Bitrate</dt>
				<dd>
					The rate at which information is streamed to the aggregator and recorded locally.<br>
					<em>(Higher is better, but requires a faster internet connection for streaming. Recordings can, and should, be set as high as possible.)</em>

				<dt><dfn>7</dfn> Signal Detection Levels</dt>
				<dd>
					The volume threshold beyond which audio will be broadcast - essentially a noise gate.
