			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Highlander, at it's core, is a file management and organisation system. It is the software that Utter uses to orgaanise and store all pre-recorded peices, jingles, idents, beds, and broadcast recordings.<br>
			</p>
			<h2>Set-by-step</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>Making a cartwall</summary>
				<p>
					Before you can put anything on a cartwall, you need to upload the media to the right place in Highlander.<br>
					Using the <mark>Workspaces bar</mark> on the left <dfn>1</dfn>, find and select a workspace that is appropriate and intuitive for your media (i.e. Jingles for show idents, SFX for quiz buzzers, or Beds for news themes).
				</p>
				<p>
					With an appropriate workspace selected, click the <mark>Import media</mark> button <dfn>2</dfn>, a window will open prompting you to add files for import. Multiple files can be added and imported simultaneously.<br>
					Once you have added all files you need to import, click <em>Okay</em> and the added media will be imported to the workspace selected in Highlander.
				</p>
				<p>
					After uploading the files, turn your attention to the <mark>CartManager</mark> menu <dfn>3</dfn>. Here,	there are 5 main folders - each corresponding with a cartwall account.<br>
					Expand the folder for the cartwall account used for your show (Studio A for shows broadcast in studio A, B for shows in B, and C for shows in C), a list of pages will drop down.<br>
					Choose a page with free space available, right click and select <em>New</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Locate your uploaded files in the <mark>File explorer</mark> <dfn>4</dfn> and drag them into the <mark>Cartwall panel</mark> <dfn>5</dfn>.<br>
					Bear in mind that Highlander's search bar looks only for exact matches, so if you don't know exactlywhat your files are called then it won't be useful.
				</p>
			</details>

				<summary>Recording a show</summary>
				<p>
					Using the <mark>Workspaces bar</mark> on the left <dfn>1</dfn>, find and select a workspace that is appropriate and intuitive for your show recording.<br/>
					With a workspace selected, open the <mark>File</mark> menu on the top bar <dfn>2</dfn>, and select <mark>New</mark> > <mark>General-DIGA-empty</mark> <dfn>3</dfn>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A window will open containing settings for the DIGA you are creating, here you can fill out the metadata for your recording.
				</p>
				<P>
					The recording will need a title. There are various title types, but the essential ones are <mark>Title</mark> <dfn>4</dfn>, which will be displayed in the highlander file explorer, <mark>Cartplayer title</mark> <dfn>5</dfn>, which will display on the carwall if the recoding is loaded, and <mark>Public title</mark> <dfn>6</dfn>, which displays on the broadcast when the recording is on air.
				</P>
				<p>
					Programme credits are added using the <mark>Performers</mark> window.<br/>
					Clicking the plus button <dfn>7</dfn> will open a window where you can fill out details for the people involved in the recording. People who's details have already been filled out will be listed when you start typing their name.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once all the details and credits for your recording have been filled out, you can close the take data card.<br/>
					Your newly created recording take will appear in the file explorer under whicever workspace and subfolder you had chosen. Locate and select it; then, from the tool bar at the top of Highlander, click the <mark>Record</mark> button <dfn>8</dfn>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A recording window will open up, it will be picking up adio from the desk.<br/>
					To begin a recording, set it to <em>recording mode</em> by clicking the red <mark>Record</mark> button <dfn>8</dfn>, then click <mark>Play</mark> <dfn>9</dfn>.<br/>
					Carry out your broadcast as though it were being broadcast live, all audio coming out of the mixing desk will be recorded onto your take in Highlander.<br/>
					You can listen back through your recording by disabling <em>recording mode</em> and using the <mark>Play</mark> button <dfn>9</dfn> and adjacent playback controls.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you have completed your show, and are happy with the recording, hit <mark>Save</mark> <dfn>10</dfn> to save the recording to the take you selected earlier.
