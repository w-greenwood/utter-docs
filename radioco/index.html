			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Radio.co is the online platform Utter uses to schedule and agregate its broadcasts. It is recommended tat you familiarise yourself with the platform and its interface.
			</p>

			<h2>Step-by-step</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>Live shows</summary>
				<p>
					Scheduling a live broadcast on Utter's <em>radio.co</em> page is fairly straightforward. Let's imagine Johnny Utter has a live talk show going out every week at 4pm on a Wednesday. The first thing you need to do is set up a schedule, so radio.co know when the show will be going out.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/sidebar.schedule.png">
				<p>
					From the sidebar, open the <mark>Schedule</mark> tab, and click the <mark>Add Event</mark> button on the top right. A popup will open with settings for the scheduled event.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/schedule.createvent.guide.png">
				<p>
					From here, you input the start time, duration, and day of the broadcast. You can set it to repeat with an interval of 1, 2, or 4 weeks. The playlist selected at the top will play out if <em>radio.co</em> is not receiving a feed from Utter.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the purposes of Johnny Utter's talk show, the Event Type will be set to <mark>LiveDJ</mark>, since that allows you to tell <em>radio.co</em> who the host is. On the right, there is also an option to record the broadcast. Broadcasts that are recorded are saved in the Recordings tab in the Media view. Likewise, you'll want to leave the track information at default, as that way it will use the metadata sent out by Utter.<br>
					When you click Create Event, you will see the show added to the weekly schedule. Once you've done that, you need to make sure Utter can actually send a feed to <em>radio.co</em>. Return to the dashboard and find the Host, Port, and Pass details at the top right.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/dashboard.topbar.png">
				<p>
					These are the details that <em>Butt</em> needs in order to send its feed to <em>radio.co</em>. To check that they match, open <em>Butt</em>, click settings, and under server settings, click edit. A new wndow will open containing the server Address (host), Port, and Passowrd.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/buttsettings.png">
				<p>
					As long as these details match, <em>Butt</em> will be able to connect and broadcast Utter through <em>radio.co</em>. From here, all you need to do is make sure Johnny Utter is in the studio on time and press the Connect to Server button <em>Butt</em> at the start of the scheduled show.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Pre-recs</summary>
				<p>
					Pre-recoreded content can be uploaded and scheduled on <em>radio.co</em> using the playlists feature. Let's imagine Johnny Utter has recorded and porduced a show in the studio, and wants it to go out every Thursday at 5pm. Before we can schedule this, we need to create a playlist for the pre-recorded show to go into. Open the playlists view, type the name of your new playlist into the search bar, and then click the Add button.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/sidebar.playlists.png">
				<img src="./media/playlist.new.png">
				<p>
					Straight away, a window will open asking you to move media into your new playlist. Before you can move it across, you'll need to add your sow to the media pool using the red Add Media button on the top right.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/playlist.addmedia.png">
				<p>
					Once you've dragged the show into the add media popup, you will need to refresh the page for it to appear in the media list. By default, media will be sent into the "tracks" tab, you will need to upload the shows in the media view in order to put them into other catagories. Click the plus button on the track to add it into the playlist. If you have multiple shows to upload, and want them to play out in chronological order, set the Resume opton to On. This will make the playlist carry on from the end of the last file played on the show.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/playlist.resume.png">
				<p>
					Playlists with Resume turned off will restart from the begining on every show. Bear in mind, playlists will always play in order from top to bottom. Even when Resume is turned off. Now that your playlist has been created, you can save changes and move to the Schedule view.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/sidebar.schedule.png">
				<p>
					From here, create a new event as you would for a live show, but make sure you set the event type to Playlist, and have the show's playlist selected.
				</p>
				<img src="./media/schedule.createprerec.png">
				<p>
					Turning Overrun on will ensure that the episode (track) playing at the end of the show will be allowed to finish before the show is cut off - even if this pushes the show over the schedule.
				</p>
